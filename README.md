# Nogeese AUR
AUR for Nogeese Linux.
## Can i get this AUR on Arch Linux?
Maybe your here from the mirror's README, but you can!

But like the nogeese repo, it was made for Nogeese Linux.

If you want it follow these steps:

Open "/etc/pacman.conf" in a text editor and

Add this line:

```
[aur]
Server = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leon8326-nogeese/aur/main/aur
SigLevel = TrustAll
```
